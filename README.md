This repository contains the public demo version of my AI-powered Email Assistant.

The demo illustrates:

- a basic Flask interface  
- simple email generation  
- user inputs (purpose, tone, key points)  
- a lightweight template generator  

---

## Note — This is Not the Full Production System

My real system (kept private) includes:

- multi-source retrieval (TXT, PDF, JSON)  
- semantic search and embeddings  
- FAISS vector store  
- intent classification  
- tone adaptation  
- customer memory  
- multi-tenant architecture  
- knowledge base integration  
- advanced email generation engine  

The production version is a complete AI Customer Support SaaS, architected privately for security and IP protection.

This repository exists purely for showcasing a safe demo of the interface and interaction flow.

## Tech Stack (Demo Version)

- Python  
- Flask  
- HTML (Jinja templates)

## Features (Demo Only)

## Why the Production Features Are Private

The real system contains proprietary and security-sensitive components such as:

- retrieval logic  
- multi-tenant architecture  
- prompt engineering  
- AI workflows  
- knowledge base integration  
- performance optimizations  
- advanced generation pipeline  

These are part of a larger SaaS product and are not open-sourced for IP protection.
